# **Ball Avoidance Game - Rules**
An algorithm that guides a ball escape from random generate blocks. 
- BFS
- Euclidean Distance
- Collision Detection
- Greedy Algorithm
- A-Star*

# **Rules**

## **Objective**  
Control a green ball to avoid falling red obstacles for as long as possible. The longer you survive, the higher your score.

## **Gameplay**  
- The player controls a **green ball** that starts at the center of the screen.
- **Red obstacles (blocks)** fall from the top of the screen at a constant speed.
- The goal is to **avoid collisions** with the falling obstacles.
- The game continues until the ball collides with an obstacle.

## **Controls & Movement**  
- The ball can move **left, right, up, or down**.
- Movement is determined by an **automated AI system** that calculates the safest path to avoid obstacles.
- The AI considers the ball's position and the trajectory of obstacles before deciding the best move.

## **Game Mechanics**  
- Obstacles appear at random horizontal positions and **fall at a constant speed**.
- The ballâ€™s movement is restricted within the game window, ensuring it doesnâ€™t go off-screen.
- Collision detection is used to check if the ball touches an obstacle. If a collision occurs, the game ends.

## **Scoring**  
- The score is based on the **number of obstacles** that have appeared before the game ends.
- The longer you survive, the higher your score.

## **Game Over Condition**  
- The game ends when the **green ball collides** with a red obstacle.
- The final score is displayed on the screen.

Enjoy the challenge of avoiding obstacles and achieving the highest score! ðŸš€
